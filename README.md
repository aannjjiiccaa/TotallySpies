# Garaža Frontier Hackathon 2025
**Team:** Totally Spies!

**Team Members:** Nemanja, Anja, Marija, Staša

**Project Name:** CodeAtlas 

**Type:** Hackathon Prototype  

**Status:** Proof of Concept / MVP  

## Overview
This is a demo application built by **Team Totally Spies** for the Garaža Frontier Hackathon 2025. 
The app showcases a working prototype with core functionality to demonstrate our concept.  

CodeAtlas is designed to be an **onboarding helper** and a **team productivity booster** for software projects. 
The app aggregates multiple related Git repositories and uses a parser to detect all internal and external connections between files, services and repos (e.g. via HTTP calls).  

It builds a **connectivity graph** of the entire codebase, which becomes the backbone of the app. Features include:  
- **Visualization:** Interactive graph showing how repos, files and services are connected.  
- **LLM-Powered Explanations:** Contextual explanations for each file, helping new team members understand the project faster.  
- **Chatbot:** Allows teams to ask questions about the codebase and receive answers in natural language.  

Essentially, CodeAtlas makes onboarding smoother, accelerates understanding of complex projects and provides a **single interface to explore and reason about code connections**.

This project is designed for rapid development and demonstration. It is **not production-ready**, but it highlights the main idea effectively.
