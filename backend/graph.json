The core optimizer (lasso_coordinate_descent) solves the LASSO objective using coordinate descent with an intercept update. RMSE and k\u2011fold index utilities support evaluation. cross_validate_lasso runs k\u2011fold CV over a grid of lambda values, standardizing each fold, fitting LASSO, and collecting mean and std RMSEs to pick the best lambda. The main function loads a CSV, performs CV, plots the CV curve, retrains on the full data with the optimal lambda, and prints the intercept, non\u2011zero coefficients with their polynomial terms, and the estimated RMSE."

It splits the data (80% train, 20% test) and standardizes features with StandardScaler. A Keras Sequential model with two hidden ReLU layers (10 and 5 units) and a sigmoid output is defined and compiled for binary cross\u2011entropy with Adam optimizer. The model is first trained on the training set with early stopping based on validation accuracy. After initial evaluation, a 5\u2011fold KFold cross\u2011validation is performed on the training data: each fold retrains the same model (with early stopping), records validation accuracy, and tracks the best\u2011performing model. Finally, the best model predicts on the held\u2011out test set, rounds predictions, and reports test accuracy using sklearn's accuracy_score."
